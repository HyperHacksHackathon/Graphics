## About
HyperHacks is an online event where software and hardware developers from around the world form teams to create a project in only 48 hours. This type of event is typically called a “hackathon”. Our hackathon is focused on innovation. We want to inspire students to create a unique project that brings value to society. Through our workshops, we want to give participants the knowledge to take their project further after the hackathon ends.
